1556,prof,Profound Medical Corp. - common stock,"Hi there! Its been a long and confusing day.

England has re-entered a national lockdown, which means that most people will have to stay home until December 2nd. 

SUMMARY
From Thursday 5th November, people are to stay at home. 

 Exceptions include: 

small_blue_diamond Education
small_blue_diamond Working, if you cannot work from home
small_blue_diamond Exercise and recreation outdoors
small_blue_diamond Medical reasons
small_blue_diamond Shopping for food and essentials
small_blue_diamond Caring for others

Here is a summary of things that are changing, and things that are not changing:

small_blue_diamond Bars and restaurants will close, but takeaways can continue to operate - as in the spring lockdown
small_blue_diamond Shielding measures will not be re-introduced, but vulnerable people or those aged over 70 are told to be especially careful
small_blue_diamond Schools and universities will be kept open throughout this period, unlike in the lockdown earlier this year

Furlough

The furlough scheme has been extended, so if your place of work has been forced to close, then you can expect a continuation of government support.

Implementation

Parliament will debate and vote on these measures on Wednesday.
Johnson says the government in Westminster has updated the devolved administrations, and ministers ""stand ready to work with them on plans for Christmas and beyond"".

Outlook
'All the solutions are bad' - Prof. Chris Whitty 
Prof Whitty says ""the idea that there is some perfect time to act is a complete misapprehension"".
He says ""all the solutions are bad"" and the government is trying to go with ""the least bad set of solutions"".

After December 2nd, lockdown will end and the nation will return to the regional 'Tier' system that was in place prior to the new announcement.

Hopefully this has been a useful summary for you all, and everyone here at r/6thForm hopes that you stay safe in these uncertain times.

SUMMARY
From Thursday 5th November, people are to stay at home. 

 Exceptions include: 

small_blue_diamond Education
small_blue_diamond Working, if you cannot work from home
small_blue_diamond Exercise and recreation outdoors
small_blue_diamond Medical reasons
small_blue_diamond Shopping for food and essentials
small_blue_diamond Caring for others

Here is a summary of things that are changing, and things that are not changing:

small_blue_diamond Bars and restaurants will close, but takeaways can continue to operate - as in the spring lockdown
small_blue_diamond Shielding measures will not be re-introduced, but vulnerable people or those aged over 70 are told to be especially careful
small_blue_diamond Schools and universities will be kept open throughout this period, unlike in the lockdown earlier this year

Furlough

The furlough scheme has been extended, so if your place of work has been forced to close, then you can expect a continuation of government support.

Implementation

Parliament will debate and vote on these measures on Wednesday.
Johnson says the government in Westminster has updated the devolved administrations, and ministers ""stand ready to work with them on plans for Christmas and beyond"".

Outlook
'All the solutions are bad' - Prof. Chris Whitty 
Prof Whitty says ""the idea that there is some perfect time to act is a complete misapprehension"".
He says ""all the solutions are bad"" and the government is trying to go with ""the least bad set of solutions"".

After December 2nd, lockdown will end and the nation will return to the regional 'Tier' system that was in place prior to the new announcement.

Hopefully this has been a useful summary for you all, and everyone here at r/6thForm hopes that you stay safe in these uncertain times.

<@!301844988608905216> You're correct, it would return a lot of results.  I would add filters such as stock price, average volume, and other filters to narrow down the stocks I want to day trade.  I've been searching for this filter and the popular screeners do not have this feature available (FinViz, eSignal, etc.).   I think this would be a valuable filter feature for day traders as we can research stocks that experience volatility within the trading by a search price we enter, and the stock experiences this volatility regularly.  I'm basically, looking for volatile stocks between $3 dollars and $20 dollars that experience price changes above $0.25 cents in the trading day, and it occurs regularly for the stock.  I would enter at least 1.5 million for average volume.  If you have an alternative recommendation I would be very grateful for feedback.

Is there a stock screener or other tool that can search for stocks with the following filters? This is for historical data. It is not for live data. I am not searching for end of day prices.

When I say ""Intraday"" below, I mean at any point in the trading day. So a stock may have opened at $5.00, went up by 5 cents by 10am, then went down by 10 cents at 11am, then went up by 25 cents by 12pm, and then went down by 25 cents by 1pm.

A filter where I can enter the amount of intraday change in price **EACH** day for a period of days, and the tool will display all the stocks that experienced this Intraday day change in price. The change in price can be up or down. Example as follows:

Let's say I want to view intraday price changes over a 5 day period. If I enter $0.25 cents for intraday price change for a 5 day period, the system will display all stocks that experienced a $0.25 cent intraday price change **EACH** day of the 5 day period. The change in price can be up or down.

8486,exas,Exact Sciences Corporation - Common Stock,Just an update to free chat. I really don‚Äôt know how you sit there and keep watching this and don‚Äôt want to upgrade. Day 27.  Now we are rolling. I had to sit and wait patiently for this to start rolling. Made almost 20k on beyond alone. Posted already. Trimmed all the way out to just a couple contracts.  Got positive on exas in the morning and trimmed down to a more reasonable position. Added all the earnings yolos from the members for a chance for them to win money in kick backs if their trades win. We are a family here. Besides that only added tho. What a killer day. Now I‚Äôll wait for another set up like this trying to stack steady gains in the meantime. Account is up basically 3900 percent in less than 30 days @here. You won‚Äôt find another group owner risk 6k of his own money on next day expirations just to try to see if they can make money. Good luck boys. We will see tomorrow,2019-09-26 15:23:23.084000-05:00,15.383333333333333,0.9612,0.9612,text6,Misc,0.797,0.797,0.05,9,2019,positive

9732,exas,Exact Sciences Corporation - Common Stock,Just an update to free chat. I really don‚Äôt know how you sit there and keep watching this and don‚Äôt want to upgrade. Day 27.  Now we are rolling. I had to sit and wait patiently for this to start rolling. Made almost 20k on beyond alone. Posted already. Trimmed all the way out to just a couple contracts.  Got positive on exas in the morning and trimmed down to a more reasonable position. Added all the earnings yolos from the members for a chance for them to win money in kick backs if their trades win. We are a family here. Besides that only added tho. What a killer day. Now I‚Äôll wait for another set up like this trying to stack steady gains in the meantime. Account is up basically 3900 percent in less than 30 days @here. You won‚Äôt find another group owner risk 6k of his own money on next day expirations just to try to see if they can make money.

As written now, the legislation has no hope of advancing in the  GOP -controlled  Senate , but many centrist Democrats were eager to pass a new bill before they returned to campaigning in their home districts.

Ie run up plus good earnings my guess is AH sell-off.

And if there is another sell-off today and earnkngs is good I think AH tonight will spike.

For me I am going to watch and play if the stock shows clear direction I am going to day trade and scalp. Probably will not have a open position during the earnings report.",2020-10-21 05:40:29.773000-05:00,5.666666666666667,0.9201,0.9201,sentiment,OmegaTrades,0.859,0.859,0.0,10,2020,positive

I don't do PTs because pennies usually really on momentum. So an accurate price target is when it breaks support.

I can also tell you support is around .34-.36, RSI is testing overbought
